    "Chapter 7 of the textbook covers three main methods of data management for web scrapers: storing media files, storing data in CSV files, and storing data in MySQL database. In the following, we learn how to write data to a CSV file using Python's built-in `csv` module. The `pandas` library provides an alternative for this task. "

    "\n",
    "The **CSV (Comma Separated Values) format** is the most common import and export format for spreadsheets and databases. A CSV file allows data to be saved in a tabular structure with a .csv extension. \n",
    "\n",
    "CSV format was used for many years prior to attempts to describe the format in a standardized way. The lack of a well-defined standard means that subtle differences often exist . These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files from multiple sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the **delimiters** and **quoting** characters vary in the data produced and consumed by different applications, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write a single module which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details of reading and writing the data from the programmer."
